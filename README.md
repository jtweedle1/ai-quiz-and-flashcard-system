# **AI-Powered Adaptive Quiz and Flashcard System**

## **Overview**
This project is a personal endeavor to learn the basics of **AI/ML implementation** by creating a practical and educational application. The app allows users to upload text-based content (e.g., textbooks, notes, or articles) to generate quizzes and flashcards automatically. It also incorporates adaptive learning features, such as spaced repetition for flashcards and dynamic quiz difficulty adjustment.

## **Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Learn the **fundamentals of AI/ML integration** in web applications.
- Explore **Elixir and Phoenix** for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time systems.
- Gain experience working with **external AI APIs** (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
- Practice implementing **adaptive algorithms** like spaced repetition and performance-based question adjustments.
- Build a functional MVP to apply both AI/ML and full-stack development skills.

## **Features (Planned)**
### **MVP Features**
- **Content Upload**: Upload files (e.g., text, PDFs) and extract meaningful data.
- **AI-Generated Quizzes**:
  - Multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions.
  - Immediate feedback on quiz responses.
- **Flashcard System**:
  - Generate flashcards from uploaded content.
  - Spaced repetition for optimized review schedules.
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Record quiz scores and flashcard review progress.

### **Future Features**
- Advanced analytics dashboard with personalized insights.
- Gamification (badges, streaks, and leaderboards).
- Mobile responsiveness for on-the-go learning.
- Collaboration features for group study sessions.

## **Tech Stack**
### **Core Technologies**
- **Backend**: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) with [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView (or React, if necessary for complex UI needs).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user data, quiz/flashcard progress, and uploaded content.
- **AI/ML Integration**: 
  - External APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) for natural language processing and question generation.
  - Spaced repetition algorithms for adaptive flashcards.

### **Other Tools**
- **Testing**: ExUnit for backend tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment**: Fly.io or Heroku for hosting the application.
